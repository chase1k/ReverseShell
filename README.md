After referencing some sources and other repositories I was able to complete an Reverse ICMP Shell

This was done loopback to localhost for more of a proof of concept but it works :)

Here is a wireshark capture of the packets

For this project it is a C2 I made to learn more about cybersecurity!

It is pretty cool

It runs off of local host so you can do arbitrary code execution on your own console through the server!

I've tried some wacky stuff for this but i've regressed to a simplier form
I may try again for the more complicated stuff but this is a baseline revershell
P.S. thank you Ben and Sohail for the help!
